You have the card now! All u need is to implement it on your site. There are two ways you can do it!

### By Embeding from different page:

 - Create a sub-directory under the main directory, named `./c/`, and upload the card-code to that directory.
 - Navigate to the `index` file of your main directory.
 - Go to the desired line, and paste the following code:

```
<img src="./c/index.svg" alt="SPARK Profile Card">
```


### By Using Inline SVG:
 
 - You can just get the code, as its already within `<svg>...</svg>` tags, and paste it within the code.


#### And... You are Done! Ready to run it on your site!
